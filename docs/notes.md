# Development Notes & Important Information

## Current Status
- ✅ Authentication system fully implemented
- ✅ Supabase integration working
- ✅ Signup flow completed
- ✅ Database triggers and RLS policies configured
- ❌ Dashboard routing needs fixing (404 on /patient)

## Supabase Configuration
- **Email Confirmation**: DISABLED for development
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with profiles table
- **Auth**: Working with role-based user creation
- **Trigger**: `handle_new_user_fixed()` creates profiles automatically

## Known Issues & Solutions
1. **404 on role-based routes**: Need to create catch-all route or fix routing structure
2. **Profile creation**: Working via trigger function
3. **Login flow**: Redirects correctly but pages don't exist

## File Structure Issues
- Dashboard routes: `/[role]/patient/page.tsx` exists
- URL pattern: `/patient` (missing [role] segment)
- Need to fix routing or create direct routes

## Authentication Flow
1. User signs up → Success alert
2. User signs in → Redirects to `/patient` or `/doctor`
3. Dashboard should load with sidebar and content

## Next Steps
- Fix dashboard routing (404 issue)
- Test complete user flow
- Implement remaining dashboard features

## Database Schema
- `auth.users`: Supabase managed
- `profiles`: Custom table with user details
- Trigger: Auto-creates profile on user signup
- RLS: Protects user data access

## Important Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development server
- Supabase Dashboard: Manage database and auth settings
- SQL Editor: Run database fixes and queries
